Using our brand new Truncate component, it's super easy to cut long words and sentences into a shorter form. Just set how many characters you want to display, and the Truncate component will do the dirty work. You can also set how many characters you want to preserve from the end of the long word, in case you want to cut out the middle.

This functionality is super helpful when you have to design with user generated content, where you cannot be exactly sure how long values will be.

Learn more about this component on its [documentation page](https://redirector.gservice.emarsys.net/ui/latest/doc/truncate.html){:target="_top"}.
