We've introduced a standalone Time Picker component! Up until now, this handy input was only available as part of the date-time picker - but now, it can be used on its own, giving our users the power to select hours and minutes easily. Learn more about this component on its [documentation page](https://redirector.gservice.emarsys.net/ui/latest/doc/timepicker.html){:target="_top"}.
