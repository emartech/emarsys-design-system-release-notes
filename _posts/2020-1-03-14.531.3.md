![Criteria](/{{ site.baseurl }}/images/widget.png)

Introducing the [`e-widget`](https://redirector.eservice.emarsys.net/ui/latest/doc/widget.html){:target="_top"}. Widgets are ideal to display standalone data, like charts and tables â€” but they can also be used to include some controls that make sense on their own. Widgets feel right at home in dashboard-like pages. Head over to the [guidelines page](https://redirector.eservice.emarsys.net/ui/latest/doc/widget.html){:target="_top"} to see some pointers and examples.

## New Components:

- `e-inputgroup`: "stick together" certain input components, like text input fields and buttons. Help a lot with rounded corners, too!

## New Features:

- `e-select`: a borderless variant has been added.
