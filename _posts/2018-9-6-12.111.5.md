## Lights! Camera! Action List! ðŸŽ¬

![_config.yml](/images/actionlist.png)

You're up and running!

We're introducing [`e-actionlist`](https://redirector.eservice.emarsys.net/ui/latest/doc/actionlist.html){:target="_top"}, a brand new component which can display a list of actions â€” kind of like the list that's opened by our `e-dropdown` component. The items are searchable, groupable, and can have various different states.

This component will be used by _Personalization_, when users are inserting tokens: clicking on the "Insert Personalization" button brings up an Action List full of tokens, and the token is automatically inserted when the user picks it from the list.

As always, if you feel like you have something that could be replaced by this new component, go ahead and implement it â€” or if you'd like to have it expanded by new functionalities for your product, get in touch with us!

## New Features
- `e-datetimepicker` handles ISO datetime string (without timezone)
- `e-datagrid` can display errors from server-side
- `e-numeric` can display numbers in humanized format (e.g. 200K)
- `e-style` icon
- `e-dialog` handles HTML in headline attribute
- `e-daterangepicker-preset` handles last hour(s) (e.g. "Last 6 hours")

## Improvements
- `e-multiselect` dispatches events for clear and select all
- `e-datepicker` dispatches event on clear

## Bug Fixes
- `e-datetimepicker` time parsing if value is not a datetime
- `e-datepicker` disable state in `e-input` fixed
