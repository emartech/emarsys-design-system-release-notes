## Criteria

![Criteria](/{{ site.baseurl }}/images/criteria.png)

We're introducing a new component: [`e-criteria`](https://redirector.eservice.emarsys.net/ui/latest/doc/criteria.html){:target="_top"}. This component provides an easy-to-use interface for users to set up complex queries to filter a dataset. It's ideal for finding resources based on multiple criteria – e.g. segmentation, filtering for users, filtering for products, etc.

## New Documents
- Design Principles
- Contribution Guideline
- Documentation for utility functions: Flipper Service, Config, Authentication Token
- Sample component (available in GitHub only)

## New Features
- `e-actionlist`: items now can be defined by _item setter_
- `e-actionlist`: max-height now can be defined
- `e-datagrid`: added search-keyword and search-keys attributes
- `e-datagrid`: individual words in search query are now processed (e.g. the item "hello beautiful world" will be found when searching for "hello world")
- `e-datagrid`: added Multiselect filter
- New utility class: `.e-hoverable`
- Presets can be hidden in `e-datetimepicker ` and `e-datetimerange` with the attribute _presets=hidden_
- `e-device`: now compatible with VCE components

## Fixes
This time we don't want to lengthen the release note with the countless small fixes we've done — you can find them all in the repo's GitHub history.
