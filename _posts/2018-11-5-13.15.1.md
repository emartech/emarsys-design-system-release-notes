## Breaking Change
- The `e-datagrid` select filter now returns a value without the "option-" prefix.

## New Features
- New icons for various Email Campaign types: `e-email-block-based`, `e-email-custom-html`, and `e-email-template-based`.
- `e-dialog` now has an "opened" property.
- `e-validator` now has an "opened" property, and now dispatches an event on open and on close.
- `e-select` now has a loading state.
- `e-actionlist` now has a loading state.
- Added documentation for config-service.
- Added documentation for authentication token service.
- Added a new `help` color, to be used for tooltip icons.
- Datagrid filters now have a "custom" attribute. When enabled, you can override the default logic of the filter with your own custom logic.

## Improvements
- `.e-label-outline` labels are not in uppercase anymore.
- Checkbox filters in datagrid can contain tooltips.
- `e-actionlist` has two empty states: one for no data, one for no search results.

## Bug Fixes
- `e-datepicker` does not dispatch an event when disabled.
- Datagrid filters are laid out in multiple rows if they can't fit in a single row.
