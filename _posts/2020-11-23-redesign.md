## 2020 Redesign

Just a while ago, we've gone public with our big Emarsys redesign. This was the first major design iteration on the Emarsys UI in more than 4 years, and so far we've received incredibly positive feedback from both our customers and our colleagues! There are so many things this redesign contains, including:

- A new vertical navigation sidebar with improved information architecture.
- A fresh look and feel that brings the Emarsys UI closer to the Emarsys brand with matching colors and typography.
- Icons have been redrawn in a unified style.
- A nicer and more usable login page.
