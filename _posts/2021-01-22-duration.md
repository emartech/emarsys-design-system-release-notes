With the new Duration utility, there's now an easy way to format a duration in seconds in a human readable way. Previously this functionality was only available in the Datagrid component. Learn more about this utility on its [documentation page](https://redirector.gservice.emarsys.net/ui/latest/doc/duration.html){:target="_top"}.
