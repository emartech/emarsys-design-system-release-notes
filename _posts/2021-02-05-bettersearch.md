We've expanded the search functionality in our Datagrid component. You can now search for multiple keywords, and also use quotation marks to search for exact matches. You can check it out in action on the [documentation page](https://redirector.gservice.emarsys.net/ui/latest/doc/datagrid.html){:target="_top"}.
