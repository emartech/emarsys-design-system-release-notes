## Notification Component

The new Notification component merges our old Notice and Alert components into one neat, flexible web component! This new component can be used in a myriad of different ways: for displaying useful heads-ups inside the page, or floating an error message over the whole layout. You can check out this new component at the [design system website](https://redirector.gservice.emarsys.net/ui/latest/doc/notification.html){:target="_top"}.
